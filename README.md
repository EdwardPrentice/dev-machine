## Dev Machine

Using Vagrant, VirtualBox, Ansible and Ubuntu, bring up a new general purpose development machine.

### Safe
Dev Machine makes no use of any 'pre baked' artifacts (like a vagrant box) which could introduce security concerns

### Customisable
Dev Machine is completely customisable, simply modify the tooling as you wish before running `vagrant up`

### Contributions welcome
Issues are welcome, but PRs are much more welcome!
Geography allowing, all PRs earn the author a free üç∫

Happy Hacking!
