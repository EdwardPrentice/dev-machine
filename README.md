## Dev Machine

Using Vagrant, VirtualBox, Ansible and Ubuntu, bring up a new general purpose development machine.

### Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/EdwardPrentice/dev-machine.git
cd dev-machine
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
```

#### What's included by default
By default the tooling will take the official published ubuntu image, tweak some of the configurations to make running it a bit more sensible and pleasant and then using ansible to install a bunch of tools into the vm, including a desktop environment.

### Safe
Dev Machine makes no use of any 'pre baked' artifacts (like a published vagrant box) which would introduce security concerns. The only thing it relies on is the official, published ubuntu base image. The code behind the ansible roles is auditable as they are open source.

### Customisable
Dev Machine is completely customisable, simply modify the tooling as you wish before running `vagrant up`

### Contributions welcome
Issues are welcome, but PRs are much more welcome!
